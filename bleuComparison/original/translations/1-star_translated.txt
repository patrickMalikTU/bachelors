First of all, it drags on infinitely long, in terms of content total nonsense: the simplest things do not work, but the impossible ones, of course. The superhero had to be explained a wormhole with the help of a sheet of paper. Short, pathetic performance by Matt Damon. All nasty kitsch. And the film music is still stolen (Philip Glass).

Unfortunately not right! The film starts promisingly, but then mutates into what I think is an extremely boring and poorly executed drama!

And it's definitely NOT because I was too \"stupid\" to understand him..... The plot sometimes jumps back and forth completely confused and is completely incomprehensible.

Always the same lyre - the stupid nerd who is there for amusement, the bad guys who want to market the dinosaurs, the good guys who want to save the dinosaurs. Lots of noise and dinosaur roar, in between the sacrificial care of the favorite raptor to the embarrassment pain limit. The only good thing was the optics.
